# DSE-Diploma--final-project
Today the world is moving towards automated robots and AI technologies which replace human beings 
for multi-task activities. The essence of learning and applying state-of-art technologies is paramount
to upgrade the living standards. To facilitate the above ideology, the project “Automated garbage collecting 
robot (Garby)” was initiated.
The project comprises Kinematics, Control, Embedded Applications and Image Processing. The machine learning or
AI parts, path finding algorithms and ROS (Robotic Operating Systems) are waiting to be complete. In the first 
step, the algorithms necessary for activating basic functions would be accomplished.
Conclusively, the project scope is focused on building a working prototype with the basic functions which includes
basic movements of robot and the arm, image processing task and fundamental embedded system development.
